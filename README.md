Insight data engineering challenge question

### Takeaways:
* The code has been developed using python2 and libraries like csv, os and sys have been used for file related operations
* There was a slight error in the script( I believe) run_tests.sh. I have modified the script accordingly and it passes the one test case. I had also emailed your team for the same.
* The script has been run and tested on inputs of varying sizes(10,100,1000,10000 and so on)
